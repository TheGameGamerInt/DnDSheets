# DnDSheets
Have you ever found yourself in the situation of your D&D Character Sheets not saving, not being editable, or simply being inconvenient to store?

This project aims to provide a solution to all of those problems:
- Locally stored in the browser
  - Includes export function to transfer between devices
- In-browser automated form
  - Is overridden if you start typing in the field
- Alerts you on leaving without saving
- An organized list of all your sheets

You can find it at (http://www.dndsheets.tk)[http://www.dndsheets.tk]

##### Notice:
As Heroku is used for deployment, the website might be asleep, and take a bit longer to load than usual.
- Heroku has currently disabled github deployment tokens while investigating a security breach. This means that the website will not be updated until this is reimplemented.

# CHANGELOG
## Alpha 1.0.0
- Introduced changelog
- Not much functionality yet
